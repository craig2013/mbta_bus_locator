						<div class="question">
							How do I use this app?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							You use this app by first selecting the route number for the route you want predictions for.  
							Then you select a direction you want to go.
							Once you've selected a direction you then select the stop you want to recieve the predictions for.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-container">
						<div class="question">
							How does this work?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							This service uses the NextBus API.  Nextbus uses GPS technology and computer modeling to track buses on their routes.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-container">
						<div class="question">
							What if I don't know the route number?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							Please use the <a href="http://mbta.com/rider_tools/servicenearby/" target="_blank">MBTA Find Service Nearby</a> service to find out the route number.  This app doesn't provide a way to find the route number yet.
						</div>

					<div class="question-container">
						<div class="question">
							What if no buses are running on a particular route?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>
								If no buses are running on a route you may see the text &quot;No bus predictions currently for this route&quot;.  For certain routes this may be
								temporary due to the frequency that buses are run on that route. If this is the case it will be updated eventually wit ha prediction 
								once buses are running again. 
							</p>

							<p>
								This message may also apear if the route in particular doesn't have service for the day and/or if it's 
								later then 1:00 AM since service ends every night at this time and resumes the next morning at 5:00 Am for certain routes. Please 
								check your route schedule for more information.   You can find bus schedules <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/bus/" target="_blank">here</a>.								
							</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-container">
						<div class="question">
							Why am I seeing buses also at this stop?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							Sometimes bus stops will have buses from multiple bus routes stop at a particular bus stop and you may not have selected 
							that bus route for predictions so you will also see those other bus routes.
